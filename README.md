# ZoomZoom

__Version:__ 1.14+

__Description:__

This was a pack i made myself back in the day when Java players was using Optifine Zoom, This was the best i could come up with for Bedrock edition. It uses the ```Minecraft:in_zoom``` components to mimic the zoom feature.

This behaviour pack has subpacks; meaning you can choose from the following options:

* Off
* Sneak
* Sneak with Stick in Hand

Use the 'Cog' next to the deactive button to change between modes

When in game just sneak or sneak with a stick in your hand to 'Zoom' in.

(I have tested this in 1.17 and suprisingly this still works, may change the stick mode to spy glass)
